    "\n",
    "Tableau is a powerful tool for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards from structured data. Below are the core concepts and functionalities to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Connecting to Data\n",
    "- Tableau can connect to a wide range of data sources:\n",
    "  - **Flat files** → Excel, CSV, Google Sheets.\n",
    "  - **Databases** → SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.\n",
    "  - **Cloud services** → AWS (Redshift, Athena, S3), Google Cloud, Azure.\n",
    "- **Live connection**: Queries data directly from the source in real time.\n",
    "- **Extract (TDE/Hyper)**: Data is imported into Tableau’s fast in-memory engine for better performance.\n",
    "- After connecting:\n",
    "  - Drag tables into the canvas in the **Data Source** tab.\n",
    "  - Define relationships or joins between them.\n",
    "  - Check metadata view to see fields, data types, and row counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joins\n",
    "- **Joins** combine tables at the row level (like SQL).  \n",
    "- Types:\n",
    "  - **Inner Join** → Only rows with matching values in both tables.  \n",
    "  - **Left Join** → All rows from the left table + matching rows from the right.  \n",
    "  - **Right Join** → All rows from the right table + matching rows from the left.  \n",
    "  - **Full Outer Join** → All rows from both tables.  \n",
    "- Joins create a **single flattened dataset** before visualization.  \n",
    "- Use when you need **fixed table structure** or strict join behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px;\">\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        <img src=\"outer_venn.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        <img src=\"inner_venn.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "        <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Left Join</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships\n",
    "- **Relationships** are logical connections between tables (introduced in Tableau 2020.2).  \n",
    "- Benefits:\n",
    "  - Preserves table-level granularity.  \n",
    "  - Tableau queries the tables **only when needed** for the visualization.  \n",
    "  - Reduces risk of duplicate rows or inflated aggregates.  \n",
    "- Joins happen **at query time**, based on the fields used in the worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![relationship](relationship.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Distinction: Joins vs. Relationships\n",
    "- **Venn Diagram icon** → Join (row-level merge).  \n",
    "- **Single Line** → Relationship (logical link).  \n",
    "- **Behavior:**\n",
    "  - Relationships do **not guarantee a strict Left Join**; Tableau decides how to combine tables based on fields in the worksheet.  \n",
    "  - Explicit Left Join (Venn diagram) is required if you need **all rows from the left table** regardless of matches in the right table.\n",
    "- **Performance**:\n",
    "    - **Joins:** Queries read the pre-joined dataset, so can be faster for small-to-medium tables.\n",
    "    - **Relationships:** May take longer for large datasets or complex queries since joins are generated on the fly, but avoids unnecessary data scanning and preserves accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Worksheets\n",
    "- **Worksheets** are where you build visualizations.  \n",
    "- You drag data fields (dimensions/measures) into **Rows** and **Columns** shelves to define the structure of the visualization.  \n",
    "- You then use the **Marks card** to control how data is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Types\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: Qualitative fields (e.g., names, categories, dates).  \n",
    "  - Usually used for slicing the data.\n",
    "  - Blue colour, usually discrete and create headers\n",
    "- **Measures**: Quantitative fields (e.g., sales, revenue, counts).  \n",
    "  - Usually used for aggregation (sum, avg, min, max).\n",
    "  - Green colour, usually continuous and can be used for axis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Marks\n",
    "The **Marks card** customizes how data points are shown in the visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color** → Change color of graphs/lines/bars by dimension or measure.  \n",
    "- **Size** → Adjust size of marks (e.g., bigger bubble for higher values).  \n",
    "- **Label/Text** → Display labels (e.g., totals, min/max, percentages).  \n",
    "- **Detail** → Add additional fields to provide more context without affecting axes.  \n",
    "- **Tooltip** → Customize what appears when hovering over data points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Filters\n",
    "- Filters limit the data displayed in a worksheet.  \n",
    "- You can **add a filter** on dimensions or measures.  \n",
    "- Option to **Show Filter** makes it interactive for users (dropdowns, sliders, checkboxes).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Dashboards\n",
    "- **Dashboards** are collections of worksheets arranged together.  \n",
    "- You can combine multiple views to provide a full story.  \n",
    "- **Size**: Usually set to automatic, but can be fixed for different screen types (desktop, tablet, phone).  \n",
    "- Can add interactive elements like filters and actions (clicking on one chart filters others).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Bins\n",
    "- **Bins** group numeric data into ranges (like buckets).  \n",
    "- Useful for histograms or stacked bar charts.  \n",
    "- Can only be created for numeric fields (`#` icon).  \n",
    "- Example: Group ages into 0–10, 11–20, etc.  \n",
    "- Create bins: Right-click field → *Create* → *Bins* → Now treated as categorical.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Table Calculations\n",
    "- Perform calculations on the data already in the view (after aggregation).  \n",
    "- Examples: Running totals, percent of total, moving averages.  \n",
    "- Two ways:  \n",
    "  - **Quick Table Calculations** (prebuilt like % of total).  \n",
    "  - **Custom Calculations** (using formulas).  \n",
    "- Tip: Hold **Ctrl (or Cmd)** and drag a field to duplicate it for calculation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Common Visualizations\n",
    "- **Bar & Line Graphs** → Show categories with values, combine bar and line for dual insight.  \n",
    "- **Maps** → For location-based data (requires geographic fields like country, city, lat/long).  \n",
    "- **Pie Charts** → Show proportions (use sparingly).  \n",
    "- **Box-and-Whisker Plot** → Summarize distributions and outliers.  \n",
    "- **Histograms** → Show frequency distribution (using bins).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Tips for Interviews\n",
    "- Be ready to explain **when you’d use certain charts** (e.g., bar vs. line vs. map).  \n",
    "- Show understanding of **interactivity** (filters, dashboard actions, tooltips).  \n",
    "- Understand **the difference between dimensions and measures**.  \n",
    "- Know how to **create calculated fields** and when to use **table calculations**.  \n",
    "- Explain **why dashboards matter** (telling a story, combining multiple insights).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Create hierarchy with related dimensions by right clicking field and creating hierarchy. \n",
    "Hide fields you dont intend to use by right clicking and using hide\n",
    "You can group fields by the folders (created in the hierarchy) by clicking the down arrow next to the button with 4 dashed lines and pressing 'group by folder' \n",
    "Create new calculated field by pressing the down arrow and click 'Create Calculated Field'. Calculated fields have an = sign next to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hold control key and select multiple fields. Click 'Show me' in the top right to see recommended charts\n",
    "right click mark and press 'show filter' to see the filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Text tables: cross tabs or pivot tables. Used to show KPIs\n",
    "\n",
    "within the data pane are two automatically generated fields:\n",
    "Measure Names - discrete field that contains the names of all the measures\n",
    "Measure Values: contains a list of all the continuous measure values that are the default aggregations for the measure names\n",
    "If you select the measure names in the columns, it is designed to show a summary text table of measure values for all measure names\n",
    "\n",
    "to include another chart in the tooltip from another sheet (e.g. you have a map, and when you hover over the state, you want a chart for all cities to come up) edit tooltip and insert 'sheet' \n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice for making dashboard:\n",
    "create an eg horizontal object and place the relevant graph in the object\n",
    "by default, a filter is only applied to the connected sheet. to modify for all, right click filter, press apply to worksheets and click all"
