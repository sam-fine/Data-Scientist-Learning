Omer Davidi podcast: ceo and co-founder
- connection to climate
- Founded in late 2017
- Focused on almonds originally 
- Adds technology to areas which can have more efficiency
- 70-75% of crops depend on pollination 
- Can’t always depend on wild insects to pollinate, so we bring them in
- Bees are dying 
- Seamless integration into existing hives, didn’t ’make a new wheel’
- Looking into optimal use of sprays/ greenhouses 
- Most agricultural metrics for output of crop is soil/ weather etc, pollination is another important metric that has not been used enough in the industry 
- Largest db on bees and pollination in the world 
- Looking to bring forecasts of how much to sell to market based of eg weather predication and the data in the db above. Not in market yet
- US and Australia 
- Possible market: coffee pollination 
- One benefit they found: two separate frames of hives of bees visits a lot less flowers on average compared to if you put two frames together??? Pollination power stronger together
